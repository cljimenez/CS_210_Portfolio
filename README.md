# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project was meant to show how programming can be used in the world of finance. This specific program was meant to be used to calculate compound interest on investments.

# What did you do particularly well?
I felt that I was able to organize my code fairly well in this project considering the amount of math involved. The code did what it was intended to do and I was able to get the calculations to output in the format that I wanted.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
After finishing the class, I believe that I can now use the skills I learned to make this project more object-oriented. The current state of the project is in a very basic state that also leaves room for improvements, such as arrays and using math libraries.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I believe that the most difficult part of the code to write was making use of the calculations in the code. I believe that this would have been easier to implement if I had known how to use functions during this part of the course. Having well organized code can help in streamlining the process by leaving less room for errors or mistakes.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I believe that the skill of translating math to code is particularly useful as much of the confusion surrounding this project for me was learning how to use math efficiently in regards to programming. This skill can be used in any project that requires even the smallest amount of math as I am now able to implement math inside of my code much more quickly.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I believe that the heavy use of commments can help when reading through the code. This helps others know what exactly each piece of code is doing so that they can decide if this feature is something that could be useful for them.
